# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

## Usage

This is just a simple React.js template that uses a development mode [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.org/). When starting, look at the link in the terminal that this package will give out, copy and set in the settings of your bot from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Or set the link using the server side of your bot
